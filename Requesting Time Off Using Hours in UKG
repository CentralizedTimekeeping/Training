        <p>- <strong>All time-off requests require managerial approval.</strong> To ensure timely processing, submit your request well in advance.<br>
           - Do not wait until the last minute before the pay period closes, as approvals require sufficient time.<br>

        </p>

        <p class="footer">This method ensures that the <strong>same number of hours applies to all selected dates</strong> rather than selecting a full or half-day option.</p>
